# About
---
Hello world, MatÄ›j here. This website is a form of my personal blog, where I'll try to present my current work and give some advice on the technology I have experience with. If I grabbed your attention somewhere on the web and you'd like to start whatever project together, just hit me up, but first, let me tell you a bit about myself here.

## Who am I?
I like think of myself as a software maker with main interest in software reliability. I've had major interest in computers from a young age thanks to my dad, who brought me broken ThinkPads from his company to fix and sell. Later I became interested in video games as any other kid. I picked up programming as a hobby at high school and later started studying CS at university.

## Studies

I've finished my bachelors at [FIT BUT](https://www.fit.vut.cz/) and currently I'm studying my masters at [FI MUNI](https://www.fi.muni.cz/). Both of these Universities are located in Brno, Czech Republic, where I currently live.

## Technologies I like to work with

## Fav OS?
I put Linux on my ThinkPad and yes - I use the shower. Linux has been my daily for some years now. I've tried Ubuntu and some other mainstream distros, but found myself liking [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) with Gnome the most. Aside from that, I still keep Windows in a dual boot config, as I need it for my work at Zoner. And I also own an old Mac, which I use for occasional iOS development. But Linux is certainly my go-to.

## Phone? Tablet?
I've grown to enjoy the simplicity of iOS and the ecosystem it provides. 


## Programmers have hobbies too?
